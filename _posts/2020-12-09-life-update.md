I havenâ€™t been blogging as much lately. Oops.

### Resume Procastination 
 
 I really need to update my resume. Itâ€™s been outdated for atleast 4 years now as I never did land a tech job during that time. I do wish I could just link my blog rather than updating my resume. My blog gives me a holistic and complete picture of who I am, and itâ€™s more interesting to read(well, atleast to me ðŸ˜… ). Unfortunately, my resume doesnâ€™t offer anything tangible: I lack any work experience so I canâ€™t write about my accomplishments. I do however, have some projects under my arsenal that I could showcase. 


### Apartment Project 

Iâ€™ve been apartment searching recently. I use Kijji, the canadian version of Craigslist to find apartments. and Itâ€™s complete hell. I live in an area where the demand is high and the best apartments are taken up within minutes of being posted. I knew I could never win the hunt if I played by the rules like everybody else. I decided to break the rules; I will use my scripting knowledge to automate the entire process.
 
 My goal is to not only find a good deal on an apartment, but also ensure that it passes some criteria: 1) The apartment needs to be close to my rocking climbing gym and 2) The apartment is in walkable/bikeable distance to amenities like grocery stores. To accomplish these goals, I will take advantage of public Apiâ€™s. , namely the walkscore and googlemaps API. 

 I plan to run the script entirely on AWS rathr than locally on my machine. AWS is easier to work with, and most important of all, I like the idea of using my cloud skills to solve real world problems, In this case, my own personal problems lol. You can find more in-depth info about this project here. 


### Pre-Emptive Burnout Remediation 

Besides the apartment project, I havenâ€™t been doing anything tech-related these past 2 weeks, primarily to avoid burnout. This is suprising coming from me, whom at times, is utterly immersed in tecchnology to the point where itâ€™s the only thing I think about for an entire month. So for somone like me to come out and say that I too can suffer from burnout shows the importance of a work-life balance 

### UFC 

Lastly, Iâ€™ve been watching a ton of UFC. Itâ€™s funny because I never would have thought Iâ€™d become a fan of the sport. I had always considered it to be a barbaric blood sport enjoyed by simple-minded people. It was only until I watched a deep post-mortem analysis of a fight that changed my view. My ignorance was curbed when I found out the complexity of mma fights. Unlike boxing which is a uni-dimensional sport, MMA is a multi-dimensional, it incorporates various combat sports and martial arts from all over the world. To put simply, a good mma figher must be well-versed in a multitude of disciplines like Karate,Judo,wrestling, kickboxing, grappling, Samba, and even Boxing! Not a very simple task, right? 

This principle of broadening your skillset isn't only unique to MMA. In fact, even cloud solutions architects can benifit from taking a multi-dimensional approach to their careers.With the advent of the cloud, gone are the days where you could get away with only doing 1 thing and only 1 thing well, like networks or even databases. In today's time, the industry demands workers who are adept at a wide array of things like containers,security, networks, databases, and so on. 

Now, this isn't to say that specialists in 1 particular domain will be obsolete. Take for example Khabib Nurmagodev, arguably the greatest UFC fighter of all time. Khabib is gifted in  1 area of MMA: Wrestling. BUT to assume that his extensive knowledge in wrestling was the reason for his MMA success is a misnomer. If that was the case, we wouldn't be talking about Khabib. The reality is,  Khabib had to learn other disciplines like Judo, or boxing ,etc  to supplement his own specialty: wrestling. If anything, it would have enhanced his own fighting game by broadening his arsenal of skills. Likewise, the tech industry is no different. There will always be specialists, like network engineers but those network engineers who ended up playing around with containers in their free time stand better. Off the top of my head, they can, say, realize that rather than running their multiple on-premise IDS/IDS solutions in VMS on a box, they can dockerize each IDS/IPS solution to get the same level of isolation. And because containers are so resource-efficient, you can pack on more IDS/IDPS containers in a box than the traditional VM approach. The result? Significant cost savings for your org. 

That's all for now.

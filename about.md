Short version: 

My name is Tariq, based in Ottawa,Canada  and I'm a cloud enthusiast.

Curious to know my story? You can read it below: 

The year was 2015 when I first encountered programming as a freshmen in CS. I very much rated it, vowed that I would never do anything computer-science related. Fast forward a couple of years and I've discovered Github, FOSS, Linux, and the most important of all, an interest in programming/scripting. 

In early 2019, while still in school, I discovered cloud computing and the challenges that companies were facing in hiring scarce cloud talent. Bleeding edge Technologies like Ansible,Kubernetes,Terraform Docker, and AWS services is what the industry was shifting towards and yet, here I was in university, studying boring functional programming in a dead language(Haskell). During this time, my grades hit a record low and I was subsequently barred out of my degree program(Computer Science) until I could pad them back up by taking easy elective courses. At this point, I had 2 options: 

--Stay in school for useless courses, get the degree (What most people would have down) OR.....

--Drop out, Self-learn the hottest skills in the industry, and see if I can get a job. 



If you would like to me contact for whatever reason, **you can email me at kapooky101@gmail.com**

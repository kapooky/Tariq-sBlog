I started my programming journey back in 2015 as a freshman in Computer Science. I absolutely hated it. I vowed that I would never become a programmer. Luckily, that didn't last long as I slowly developed an interest in the craft outside of school hours. Unfortunaely, Despite my newfound interest in programming, I was still struggling in computer courses that I perceived to be boring. Inversly, The few courses that I enjoyed were  the ones in which I was succesful at(operating systems and OOP). In 2019, while still in school, I became aware of cloud computing/ dev ops trends in the industry and how much money can made due to the labor shortage of cloud skilled workers. This is the moment in which I questioned wether University was in line with the demands of the Industry, and decided it would be fun to see if I could land cloud job without a degree. 

So far, It's been an amazing journey. As cliche as it sounds, I genuinely do learn something new everyday.I made this blog to share my learnings with other cloud newbies and ramble about cooling and interesting cloud stuff.

Short version: 

I'm just a random univeristy dropout who occasionly blogs.. 

Long version: 

The year was 2015 when I started my programming journey  as a freshman in Computer Science. I absolutely hated it. I vowed that I would never become a programmer. Luckily, that didn't last long as I slowly developed an interest in the craft outside of school hours.
 
 However, I was still struggling with the vast majority of my computer science courses, namely because I perceived them to be boring, and sometimes not applicable to the real world. Inversely, The few courses that I did enjoy were the ones in which I was very successful at, namely OOP and Operating systems ( I wish I could also include Databases, but the Prof was terrible and I was too distracted with videogames to really dive deep into this fascinating subject). 

In 2019, while still in school, I became aware of cloud computing/ dev ops trends in the industry and how much money can made due to the labor shortage of cloud skilled workers. During this time, my grades hit a record low and I was subsequently kicked out of taking computer courses until I could pad them back up by taking easy elective courses. At this point, I decided to take a break from University and see if I could land a cloud job without a degree. 

So far, It's been an amazing journey, and as cliche as it sounds, I genuinely do learn something new everyday. I particularly enjoy that I have total autonomy over my own education. That is, I'm able to delve deep into topics I find intriguing, gain a hollistic perspective of the broader picture, and so forth. I made this blog to share my learnings with other cloud newbies and ramble about cooling and interesting cloud/ dev ops stuff.

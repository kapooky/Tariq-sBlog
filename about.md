Short version: 

I'm a university dropout who sometimes blogs.

Long version: 

The year was 2015 when I first encountered programming as a freshmen in CS. Very much rated it, vowed that I would never do anything computer-science related. Fast forward a couple of years and I've discovered Github, FOSS, Linux, and the most important of all, an interest in programming/scripting. 

In early 2019, while still in school, I discovered cloud computing and the challenges that companies are facing in hiring for scare cloud talent. Bleeding edge Technologies like Ansible,Kubernetes,Terraform Docker, and AWS services is what the industry was shifting towards and yet, here I was in university, studying boring functional programming in a dead language(Haskell). During this time, my grades hit a record low and I was subsequently barred out of my degree program(Computer Science) until I could pad them back up by taking easy elective courses. At this point, I decided to take a break from University and see if I could land a cloud job without a degree. 

So far, It's been an fun journey, and as cliche as it sounds, I genuinely do learn something new everyday. I made this blog to document my journey, share what I've learnt, and occasionally rant on things that frustrate me. 

If you would like to me contact for whatever reason, **you can email me at kapooky101@gmail.com**
